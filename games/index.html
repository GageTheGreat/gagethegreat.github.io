<b>About</b>
I started playing osu! on <u>March 2, 2022</u> and I found the game on youtube in late 2021, I thought it looked cool but I didnt bother to play it. In february, I started to see alot more osu! content on youtube. I finally decided to download the game and try it out. The first map I ever played was <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1011011#osu/2116202" target="_blank">new beginnings</a> by pishifat. The tutorial was easy although I got a C the first time I played it. I played some more beatmaps and then got into osu!mania in April 2022. During november I started slowing down on osu!mania, and started focusing on osu!standard. Now I'm basically a full time osu!standard player, with a little bit of mania in between. The rest of the game is pretty fun. Ive been playing for over a year and I dont plan to stop anytime soon.</p></pre>

<b>About</b>
I started playing Roblox on <u>March 24, 2018</u>. I had just saw it as a game my friends were talking about and decided to try it. I instantly grew a liking to the game. The first game I ever played was: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/77899385" target="_blank">Gravity Shift</a>. I started playing other games and took a 2 year break in between 2019 and 2021. I started playing consistently in 2022 and have been playing consistently for over a year.</p></pre>
