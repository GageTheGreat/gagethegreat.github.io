              <p>Tonight on this episode of A.N.N. we have a story about Adyn once again following everyone. As Gage and Justice reported to us, saying "He always follows us around.", and "He's literally a human magnet.". Adyn was also trying befriend Justice, asking Justice to add him on discord. He also desperately wanted to be at the exact same lunch table as Gage, Aiden, and Justice, despite all the times he's been told not to follow them. Thats all for tonights story, on A.N.N.</p>

              <p>We thought the story was finished here at A.N.N. but this story hasn't finished yet!. Adyn appears to be responding to the allegations with "ikr" and "i dont even bother reading it anymore XD". But Jaiden slaps back by saying "You are a special kind of stupid.". Jaiden says that Adyn can "Figure it out on his own.", ruining Adyns chance of making a comeback. Thats all that was unveiled in this episode of A.N.N. we'll make sure to keep posting updates, so tune in if your interested. That is all tonight, on A.N.N.</p>

              <p>Here at A.N.N. we have just been notified of some more breaking news. Jaiden is once again cracking down on the Adyn situation. If we head on into the #‚Å†art-and-fights channel we can see that we are actually viewing a live battle with Jaiden and Adyn. Jaiden currently seems to be winning in the ongoing battle, completely eradicating any chance Adyn has of beating him in the argument. Adyn is only throwing down one to two word responses, while Jaiden is writing entire paragraphs, really going out of his way to secure the win. Be sure to tune in later as more information may unfold. This is A.N.N. and we hope to see you again soon.</p>

              <p>Tonight on Adyn News, Adyn has been spotted going to dollarama, and although he was originally thought to have been following Ren and Justice, he quickly left the scene. Justice and Ren sprinted out of there luckily avoiding Adyn's wrath. This problem has persisted for many months, and locals are tired of it. Head of police, Jaiden, has been trying to resolve the problem for weeks with no avail. Thats all for tonight on, Adyn News.</p>
