              <p>Adyn Andrew Howerton is the most annoying, stupid, and unfunny person on earth. He follows people around, does anything for friends and money, and makes the worst jokes known to mankind.<br><br>Here is a graph of his annoyingness: </p>

              <p>He also has stolen from dollarama multiple times, and when asked about it he says "Justice pressured me to do it.". Even though everyone knows thats not true, he just wants to take the blame off of himself. Recent events show that he has been following people around when they dont want him to. People are tired of it. One recent event in specific is when Adyn followed Jaiden and Kohl to the park. Jaiden and his friends did not want him there, neither did Kohl. When they got home, Adyn was saying that "Jaiden's friend talked to me first ðŸ¤“." and "I was at the park first ðŸ¤“.". We all know Jaiden's friend was just trying to be nice, he never actually wanted to talk to Adyn.<br><br>Here are some images of Adyn (Jumpscare Warning | Click to view/hide):</p>
